## Building the HTML report

Include all necessary `.Rmd` files in the `index.Rmd` file (look at the file to see how it's done). Build the report by copying and pasting the following command in the Console of RStudio

```r
rmarkdown::render('index.Rmd')
```

You may need to the set the working directory to the project folder for this to work
